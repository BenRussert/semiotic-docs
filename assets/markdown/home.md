# Semiotic

Charts that carry the conversation

**Semiotic is a data visualization framework for React.**
It provides three types of frames (XYFrame, OrdinalFrame, NetworkFrame) which allow you to deploy a wide variety of charts that share the same rules for how to display information.

## Getting Started

Install and save the component to your project.

```js
npm i -SE semiotic
```

These examples use some CSS to make things look nice.
