# Semiotic

**Semiotic is a data visualization framework for React.**

It provides three types of frames XYFrame, OrdinalFrame, NetworkFrame, which allow you to deploy a wide variety of charts that share the same rules for how to display information.

This library is created and maintained by [Elijah Meeks](https://twitter.com/Elijah_Meeks).

These docs were created in collaboration with [Susie Lu](https://twitter.com/DataToViz).

## Getting Started

Install and save the component to your project with yarn or npm.

```js
yarn add -E semiotic
//or npm
npm i -SE semiotic
```

with the following import syntax:

```js
import NetworkFrame from "semiotic/lib/NetworkFrame"
```

or you can use the bundled version on unpkg.com

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/semiotic" />
```

with the following import syntax:

```js
const { NetworkFrame } = Semiotic
```

These examples use some CSS to make things look nice.
