# Semiotic

Charts that carry the conversation

**Semiotic is a data visualization framework for React.**
It provides three types of frames (XYFrame, OrdinalFrame, NetworkFrame) which allow you to deploy a wide variety of charts that share the same rules for how to display information.

## Getting Started

Install and save the component to your project with npm.

```js
npm i -SE semiotic
```

or yarn.

```js
yarn add semiotic
```

or you can use the bundled version on unpkg.com

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/semiotic" />
```

These examples use some CSS to make things look nice.
